## Scenario: RRT

### Unresponsive, 12h post laminectomy

HR and SpO2 ok. Pinpoint pupils, bradypneic. You give doses of naloxone without response. You..

1.  Continue administering naloxone until they respond

2.  Advocate for a move to the ICU

3.  Defer to primary team

## Rapid Response: The Big Picture

### Possible outcomes

1.  Turn into a **code blue** (\[[Do You Have Who/What You Need?](slides/resources.html "Resources Slides")\])

2.  **Go to ICU**

    -   Instability, too much nursing care, needs titratable drip

    -   Don't delay - faster & safer to get things done in ICU if dispo known

3.  **Stay on floor**

    -   Prompt stabilization and workup

    -   **Always** hand off to the primary team assuming care

## Scenario: Code Blue

### A young patient has an arrest, seems like a PE.

She has been in PEA at each pulse check.

Resuscitation has been going on for 40 minutes.

When do you stop?

## How long is too long?

## Things to consider:

-   Pre-arrest state? more ill (esp if chronic) shorter

-   Is the likely cause reversible? if so, longer

-   What's the rhythm? Shockable = good! Asystole = bad! PEA = transition state.

## The Family

## How to actually end an (unsuccessful) attempted resuscitation?

-   "Does anyone have ideas we haven't tried?"

-   "Let's stop CPR"

-   Thank team members

-   **Set a time & location to debrief** (5-15 mins)

    -   feedback is the way to improve

## Summary:

### Rapid Response

-   consider what's next and don't delay.

### Code blue

-   Consider pre-arrest state, causes, and rhythms. 5-60 minutes, generally.

-   Bring in family when possible

-   Always debrief.
