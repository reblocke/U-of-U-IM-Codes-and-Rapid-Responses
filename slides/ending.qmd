## Rapid Response: Unresponsive

### 12h post laminectomy

HR and SpO2 ok. Pinpoint pupils, bradypneic. You give doses of naloxone without response. You..

1.  Continue administering naloxone until they respond

2.  Advocate for a move to the ICU

3.  Defer to primary team

## Rapid Response: Possible Outcomes

-   Turn into a **code blue** (\[[Do You Have Who/What You Need?](slides/resources.html "Resources Slides")\])
-   **Go to ICU**
    -   Instability, too much nursing care, needs titratable drip
    -   Don't delay - faster & safer to get things done in ICU if dispo known
-   **Stay on floor**
    -   Prompt stabilization and workup

    -   **Always** hand off to the primary team assuming care

## Code Blue: 

### Young patient. Seems like a PE.

She has been in PEA at each pulse check.

Resuscitation has been going on for 40 minutes.

When do you stop?

## How long is too long?

## That's average, but consider:

-   Pre-arrest state? more ill (esp. if chronic) **→** shorter
-   Is the likely cause reversible? yes **→** longer
-   What's the rhythm?
    -   Shockable **→** good (longer).

    -   Asystole **→** bad (shorter).

    -   PEA can be a transition state

## The Family

## How to actually end an (unsuccessful) attempted resuscitation?

-   "Does anyone have ideas we haven't tried?"
-   "We're going to stop CPR at next check unless rhythm changes"
-   Thank team members
-   **Set a time & location to debrief** (5-15 mins)
    -   feedback is **the** way to improve

## Summary:

### Rapid Response

-   Consider what's next and don't delay.

### Code blue

-   Consider pre-arrest state, causes, and rhythms. 5-60 minutes, generally.
-   Bring in family when possible
-   Always debrief.
