## Effective Leadership Skills

1.  Establish a clear leader
2.  Collaborate and share information

## Scenario: RRT to RM S408.

### Sign-out: 81M, SVT now stable.

## Scenario: Situation

-   Suddenly, HR 160 and MAP drops 85 to 65

## Scenario: Next Steps

What's your schema for this situation?

What key data informs your treatment?

How do you convey your thinking to the room?

## Scenario: Then...

You share your assessment and plan to administer IV metoprolol with the team, then...

-   3 individuals (DOCTOR badges) you don't know enter the room and don't introduce themselves.

-   You discuss the situation with the family outside the room - many questions.

-   RN asks clarification: what metoprolol dose?

## Scenario: New Rhythm

-   While talking with family, RN calls out the patient's not responding. A new EKG shows

## Scenario (postscript)

-   Individuals are primary CV team, who are unaware it's a rapid.

-   Turns out the primary team had also told the RN to give Metop - multiple doses.

-   Patient requires trans-cutaneous pacing - who's making that decision?

What went wrong?

## Establish a clear leader:

### Are you running this RRT or not?

"I'm \_\_\_\_, the resident on the code team. Is anyone running this rapid?"

"Ok, I'm running this rapid", or "Can I take Over", or "OK, how can I help?"

## Establish a clear leader:

### Be the point person

## Collaborate and Share Information:

### Invite suggestions with a constructive tone

Try:

-   Think out loud: "That qrs is wide, but the rhythm looks irregular"

-   Summarize: "MAP is OK, I think this is AFib, so..."

-   Encourage: "Good thought, yes..."

Why?

-   The team has a lot of context-specific experience

-   Actual team dynamics: residents and (for example) experienced ICU RN's; primary team

## Scenario, Revisited

### What would you do differently?

## Scenario, Revisited

### What would you do differently?

-   Primary team identified; confirmed they want you to run response

-   Standing at the head of the bed, delegating all other tasks.

-   You verbalize your rhythm interpretation schema.

-   Ideas from the entire team
