	abstract = {Background
To manage a clinical emergency effectively, physicians need well-developed leadership skills, yet limited structured leadership training is available for critical care trainees. To develop an effective curriculum, leadership competencies must first be defined.
Research Question
During clinical emergencies, what leadership behaviors do followers value?
Study Design and Methods
We conducted qualitative interviews with members of multidisciplinary critical care teams at a large academic health system, with participants including resident physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists (N = 15). Thematic analysis was used to categorize leadership behaviors that followers perceived to be effective.
Results
We identified three themes related to leadership during clinical emergencies: control, collaboration, and common understanding. Participants described behaviors they believed resulted in both effective and ineffective leadership. For effective leaders, control, the most dominant theme, included behaviors that clearly established roles for the leader and followers, allowing the leader to guide care during a clinical emergency. Collaboration referenced the ability of a leader to maintain a collegial environment. Finally, common understanding reflected a leader’s ability to manage communication in a way that fostered a shared mental model across team members.
Interpretation
During clinical emergencies, followers value leaders who assert themselves while also maintaining positive team interaction and encouraging an organized flow of information. Our findings provide a potential framework to develop a leadership curriculum for critical care trainees.},

	abstract = {Background Good outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) depend on a skilled resuscitation team, prompt initiation of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, and organisational structures to support IHCA response. We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival.Methods We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and support for roles.Results Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted nurses as leaders—administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs.Conclusion Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing training for IHCA care. Though not proof of causation, nurses appear to be critical to effective IHCA response, and how to support their role to optimise outcomes warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background Medical team leaders in cardiac arrest teams are routinely subjected to disproportionately high levels of cognitive burden. This simulation-based study explored whether the introduction of a dedicated ‘nursing team leader’ is an effective way of cognitively offloading medical team leaders of cardiac arrest teams. It was hypothesised that reduced cognitive load may allow medical team leaders to focus on high-level tasks resulting in improved team performance.Methods This randomised controlled trial used a series of in situ simulations performed in two Australian emergency departments in 2018–2019. Teams balanced on experience were randomised to either control (traditional roles) or intervention (designated nursing team leader) groups. No crossover between groups occurred with each participant taking part in a single simulation. Debriefing data were collected for thematic analysis and quantitative evaluation of self-reported cognitive load and task efficiency was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NTLX) and a ‘task time checklist’ which was developed for this trial.Results Twenty adult cardiac arrest simulations (120 participants) were evaluated. Intervention group medical team leaders had significantly lower NTLX scores (238.4, 95\% CI 192.0 to 284.7) than those in control groups (306.3, 95\% CI 254.9 to 357.6; p=0.02). Intervention group medical team leaders working alongside a designated nursing leader role had significantly lower cognitive loads than their control group counterparts (206.4 vs 270.5, p=0.02). Teams with a designated nurse leader role had improved time to defibrillator application (23.5 s vs 59 s, p=0.004), faster correction of ineffective compressions (7.5 s vs 14 s, p=0.04), improved compression fraction (91.3 vs 89.9, p=0.048), and shorter time to address reversible causes (107.1 s vs 209.5 s, p=0.002).Conclusion Dedicated nursing team leadership in simulation based cardiac arrest teams resulted in cognitive offload for medical leaders and improved team performance.All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as online supplemental information.

Time dependent probabilities of subsequently surviving to hospital discharge or having favorable functional outcome if patients pending the first return of spontaneous circulation at each minute received further cardiopulmonary resuscitation beyond the time point were estimated, assuming that all decisions on termination of resuscitation were accurate (that is, all patients with termination of resuscitation would have invariably failed to survive if cardiopulmonary resuscitation had continued for a longer period of time).Results Among 348 996 included patients, 233 551 (66.9\%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation with a median interval of 7 (interquartile range 3-13) minutes between start of chest compressions and first return of spontaneous circulation, whereas 115 445 (33.1\%) patients did not achieve return of spontaneous circulation with a median interval of 20 (14-30) minutes between start of chest compressions and termination of resuscitation. 78 799 (22.6\%) patients survived to hospital discharge. The time dependent probabilities of survival and favorable functional outcome among patients pending return of spontaneous circulation at one minute’s duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were 22.0\% (75 645/343 866) and 15.1\% (49 769/328 771), respectively. The probabilities decreased over time and were \&lt;1\% for survival at 39 minutes and \&lt;1\% for favorable functional outcome at 32 minutes’ duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Conclusions This analysis of a large multicenter registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest quantified the time dependent probabilities of patients’ outcomes in each minute of duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The findings provide resuscitation teams, patients, and their surrogates with insights into the likelihood of favorable outcomes if patients pending the first return of spontaneous circulation continue to receive further cardiopulmonary resuscitation.No additional data available.},

	abstract = {There are no validated decision rules for terminating resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest. Decision rules may guide termination and prevent inappropriate early termination of resuscitation.To develop and validate termination of resuscitation rules for in-hospital cardiac arrest.In this prognostic study, potential decision rules were developed using a national in-hospital cardiac arrest registry from Denmark (data from 2017 to 2022) and validated using registries from Sweden (data from 2007 to 2021) and Norway (data from 2021 to 2022). Six variables (age, initial rhythm, witnessed status, monitored status, intensive care unit location, and resuscitation duration) were considered based on their bedside availability. Prognostic metrics were computed for all possible variable combinations. CIs were obtained using bootstrapping. Rules with a false-positive rate below 1\% (predicting death in patients who might otherwise survive) and a positive rate of more than 10\% (proportion of all cases for whom termination is proposed) were considered appropriate.The primary outcome was 30-day mortality.The cohorts included 9863 Danish, 12 781 Swedish, and 1308 Norwegian patients. The overall median (IQR) age was 74 (66-81) years, 63\% were male, and the median (IQR) resuscitation duration was 13 (5-23) minutes. Of 53 864 possible termination rules, 5 were identified as relevant for clinical use. The best performing rule included 4 variables (unwitnessed, unmonitored, initial rhythm of asystole, and resuscitation duration more than or equal to 10 minutes). The rule proposed termination in 110 per 1000 cardiac arrests (positive rate, 11\%; 95\% CI, 10\%-11\%) and predicted 30-day mortality incorrectly in 6 per 1000 cases (false-positive rate, 0.6\%; 95\% CI, 0.3\%-0.9\%). All 5 rules performed similarly across all 3 cohorts.In this prognostic study, 5 termination of resuscitation rules were developed and validated for in-hospital cardiac arrest. The best performing rule had a low false-positive rate and a reasonable positive rate in all national cohorts. These termination of resuscitation rules may aid decision-making during resuscitation.},

A significant body of data has recognized the efficacy of rapid response systems (RRSs) in improving patient care; however, there is no standardized protocol that all RRSs practice. Even when the recognition of patient clinical deterioration is rapidly noted, further treatment may be delayed because of issues with clinical knowledge and communication between parties present, especially in training institutions. At our institution in Southern California, the RRT consists of resident physicians supervised by an attending physician, a respiratory therapist, a critical care nurse, and a pharmacist. In our study, we assessed our responses to RAT calls at baseline, using a standardized rubric. We then implemented an educational intervention to resident physicians, including clinical and communication components. Finally, we reassessed our responses to RAT calls postintervention. We found that an educational intervention improved patient outcomes and several key process measures in our RRS. This article describes the process and lessons learned from our initiative.},

	abstract = {Aim
We sought to investigate the relationship between mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during in-hospital cardiac arrest and survival to hospital discharge.
Methods
Utilizing the prospectively collected American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines database, we performed an observational study. Data from 153 institutions across the United States were reviewed with a total of 351,125 patients suffering cardiac arrest between 2011 and 2019 were screened. After excluding patients with cardiac arrests lasting less than 5 minutes, and patients who had incomplete data, a total of 111,143 patients were included. Our primary exposure was mechanical vs. manual CPR, and the primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Multivariate logistic regression models and propensity weighted analyses were used.
Results
11.8\% of patients who received mechanical CPR survived to hospital discharge versus 16.9\% in the manual CPR group. Patients who received mechanical CPR had a lower probability of survival to discharge compared to patients who received manual CPR (OR 0.66 95\% CI 0.58–0.75; p {\textless} 0.001). This association persisted with multi-variable adjustment (OR 0.57 95\% CI 0.46–0.70, p {\textless} 0.0001) and propensity weighted analysis (OR 0.68 95\% CI 0.44–0 0.92, p {\textless} 0.0001). Mechanical CPR was associated with decrease likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation after multivariate adjustment (OR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.60–0.76; p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
Mechanical CPR was associated with a decreased likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and ROSC compared to manual CPR. This finding should be interpreted within the context of important limitations of this study and randomized trials are needed to better investigate this relationship.},

Current teaching focuses on recollection of numerous conditions that start with the letters H or T as potential causes of PEA. This teaching method is too complex, difficult to recall during resuscitation, and does not provide guidance to the most effective initial interventions. This review proposes a structured algorithm that is based on the differentiation of the PEA rhythm into narrow- or wide-complex subcategories, which simplifies the working differential and initial treatment approach.
