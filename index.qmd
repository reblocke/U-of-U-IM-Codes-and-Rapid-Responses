# Overview

## 2025 Rising PGY-2 Code and RRT Seminar {.unnumbered}

**University of Utah Internal Medicine Residency**

Bookmark for future reference.

## Agenda

1.  Survey

2.  15-minute sessions on necessary micro-skills

    1.  Leadership Style

    2.  Rhythm Interpretation

    3.  Do You Have Who/What You Need?

    4.  Ending the Code/Response

3.  Scenarios, Q&A, and Equipment

4.  Session Feedback

## Pedagogical Note: 

The right way to learn how to do this is:

-   Watch someone run a code/RRT well

-   Learn the key considerations\*

-   Imitate a well-run code/RRT (perhaps with simulation)

-   Receive Feedback

Didactics are only 1 component of this.

## Methods: 

We’ve discussed with stakeholders and participants in the rapid response & code teams to identify the most common and consequential mistakes residents make:

-   **Unfavorable team dynamics emerge**

-   It’s not clear who is running the code.

-   A shockable rhythm is not shocked.

-   Decisions are too delayed.

-   The person who activated the response gets snarked for a false alarm.

(please let us know of other events or near-misses)

## Learning Objectives

Discuss micro-skills/schemas to avoid each error.

We’re not going to review ACLS, per se. Here's a reference.

## Summary

-   **Emphasize getting the right team dynamics**

-   “I’m Joe/Jane Doe, the resident on the code team. Who is running this code/RRT?” ”Can I take over?”

-   Stand at the foot of the bed. Don’t move and don’t do tasks.

-   Keep the big picture in mind:

    -   RRT: Is this a code? Does this patient need to go to the ICU?

    -   Code: High quality compressions; shock if shockable
