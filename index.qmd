    2.  Rhythm Interpretation

    3.  Do You Have Who/What You Need?

    4.  Ending the Code/Response

3.  Scenarios, Q&A, and Equipment

4.  Session Feedback

## Pedagogical Note: 

The right way to learn how to run codes/RRTs well is:

-   Watch someone run a code/RRT well

-   Learn the key considerations

-   Imitate a well-run code/RRT (perhaps with simulation)

-   Receive Feedback

Didactics are only 1 component of this.

## Methods: 

We’ve discussed with stakeholders and participants in the rapid response & code teams to identify the most common and consequential mistakes residents make:

-   **Unfavorable team dynamics emerge**

    -   Most commonly, it’s not clear who is running the code.

-   A shockable rhythm is not shocked.

-   Decisions are too delayed.

-   The person who activated the response gets snarked for a false alarm.

Please let the CMRs (or us) know when events, near-misses, or big-wins happen. It'll help us keep this seminar relevant.

## Learning Objectives

-   Discuss micro-skills and schemas to avoid common/consequential errors that residents make.

-   Build Familiarity with the Zoll Device

-   Answer questions
