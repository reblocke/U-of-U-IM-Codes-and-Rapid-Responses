# Overview:

[Target Audience:]{.underline} Rising-PGY2s who will soon be leading Code Blue/Rapid response teams

## Learning Objectives

- Assume and communicate team leadership immediately upon arrival.

- Identify VF/VT on the monitor and deliver shocks when warranted

- Escalate care and marshal resources appropriately

- Operate the Zoll R-Series defibrillator safely and efficiently.

- Conclude the event and debrief.

::: callout-tip
Didactics alone have limits. Regular review (bookmark this!), simulation, and feedback (debrief!) will advance your skills further.

## Methods:

We surveyed stakeholders from Code Blue and Rapid Response Teams—including senior residents, nurses, respiratory therapists, and quality leads—to identify the most frequent and impactful errors during resident-led responses. Three themes emerged:

1.  **Unclear team leadership** , leading to confusion in role assignments, low psychological safety, and decreased collaboration. [@steinbach_effective_2024]

2. Failure to cardiovert or defibrillate shockable rhythms

3. Delayed critical decisions (calling for help, initial stabilization, or transpor to ICU )

This module targets these issues. Sessions are small-group and interactive, designed to draw on your personal experiences, encourage discussion, clarify questions, and conclude with hands-on practice.

::: callout-important
Please let the CMRs (or us) know when events, near-misses, or big-wins happen. It'll help us keep this seminar relevant.
