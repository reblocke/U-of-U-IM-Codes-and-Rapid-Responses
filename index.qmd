Target: Rising-PGY2s

Bookmark for future reference.

## Agenda

1.  [Survey](survey.qmd "placeholder")

2.  15-minute sessions on necessary micro-skills

    -   Leadership Style — \[[slides](slides/leadership.html "Leadership Style Slides")\]

    -   Pulse Check Decisions — \[[slides](slides/pulse_check.html "Pulse Check Decisions Slides")\]

    -   Do You Have Who/What You Need? — \[[slides](slides/resources.html "Resources Slides")\]

    -   Ending the Code / Response — \[[slides](slides/ending.html "Ending the Code/RRT Slides")\]

3.  Scenarios and Equipment

    -   [Case 1](slides/case_1.html "Case 1"), [Case 2](slides/case_2.html "Case 2"), [Case 3](slides/case_3.html "Case 3"), [Case 4](slides/case_4.html "Case 4"), [Case 5](slides/case_5.html "Case 5"), [Case 6](slides/case_6.html "Case 6")

4.  [Q&A and Summary](summary.qmd "Summary Page")

5.  [Feedback Survey](survey.qmd "Placeholder")

6.  [References](references.qmd)

## Methods:

We’ve discussed with stakeholders and participants in the rapid response & code teams to identify the most common and consequential mistakes residents make:

-   **Unfavorable team dynamics emerge**

    -   Most commonly, it’s not clear who is running the code, or collaborative dynamics aren't established. [@steinbach_effective_2024]

-   A shockable rhythm is not shocked.

-   Decisions are too delayed.

Please let the CMRs (or us) know when events, near-misses, or big-wins happen. It'll help us keep this seminar relevant.

## Learning Objectives

-   Discuss micro-skills and schemas to avoid common/consequential errors that residents make.

-   Build Familiarity with the Zoll Device

-   Answer questions

## Pedagogical Note:

The right way to learn how to run codes/RRTs well is:

-   Watch someone run a code/RRT well

-   Learn the key considerations

-   Imitate a well-run code/RRT (perhaps with simulation)

-   Receive Feedback

Didactics are only 1 component of this - continued effort required.
