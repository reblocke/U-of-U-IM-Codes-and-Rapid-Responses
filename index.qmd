## Methods:

We've ask stakeholders and Code/RRT team members: What are the the most common and consequential mistakes residents make?

1.  **Unfavorable team dynamics emerge**

    -   Most commonly, it's not clear who is running the code or collaborative dynamics aren't established. [@steinbach_effective_2024]

2.  A shockable rhythm is not shocked.

3.  Decisions are too delayed.

::: callout-important
Please let the CMRs (or us) know when events, near-misses, or big-wins happen. It'll help us keep this seminar relevant.
:::

## Learning Objectives

-   Discuss micro-skills and schemas to avoid common/consequential errors

-   Build Familiarity with the Zoll Device

-   Answer questions you may have

::: callout-tip
Didactics and discussion will only get you so far. Periodic review (**bookmark this!**), simulation, and receiving feedback (**debrief!**) will help
