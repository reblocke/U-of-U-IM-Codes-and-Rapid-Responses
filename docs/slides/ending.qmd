## Scenario: RRT

### Unresponsive, 12h post laminectomy

HR and SpO2 ok. Pinpoint pupils, bradypneic. You give doses of naloxone without response. You..

1.  Continue administering naloxone until they respond

2.  Advocate for a move to the ICU

3.  Defer to primary team

## Rapid Response: The Big Picture

### Possible outcomes

1.  Turn into a **code blue** (Do You Have Who/What You Need?— \[[slides](slides/resources.html "Resources Slides")\] \[[outline](slides/resources.qmd "Resources Outline")\])

2.  **Go to ICU**

    -   Considerations: instability, too frequent nursing care, initation of titrable drip

    -   Don't delay - often faster and safer to get things done in ICU if dispo known (answer 2)

3.  **Stay on floor**

    -   Generally need prompt stabilization and workup

    -   Always hand off to the primary team assuming care

## Scenario: Code Blue

A young female patient has an arrest presumably from PE.

She has been in PEA at each pulse check.

Resuscitation has been going on for 40 minutes.

When do you stop?

## How long is too long?

Things to consider:

-   Pre-arrest state? more ill (esp if chronic) shorter

-   Is the likely cause reversible? if so, longer

-   What's the rhythm? Shockable = good! Asystole = bad! PEA = transition state.

## The Family

## How to actually end an (unsuccessful) attempted resuscitation?

-   "Does anyone have ideas we haven't tried?"

-   "Let's stop CPR"

-   Thank team members

-   **Set a time & location to debrief** (soon)

    -   the way to get better

## Summary: 

### Rapid Response

consider what's next and don't delay.

### Code blue

-   consider pre-arrest state, causes, and rhythms. 5-60 minutes, generally.

-   bring in family when possible

-   Always debrief.
